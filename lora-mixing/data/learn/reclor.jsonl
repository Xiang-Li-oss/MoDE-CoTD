{"input": "Infer the correct choice for the question.\n\nQ: Prominent business executives often play active roles in United States presidential campaigns as fund-raisers or backroom strategists, but few actually seek to become president themselves. Throughout history the great majority of those who have sought to become president have been lawyers, military leaders, or full-time politicians.

As a result, business executives tend to be uncomfortable with compromises and power-sharing, which are inherent in politics.\nWhich one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the proposed explanation of why business executives do not run for president? Answer Choices: (A) Many of the most active presidential fund-raisers and backroom strategists are themselves politicians.
