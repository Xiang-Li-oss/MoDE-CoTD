The key words are \"reproduce,\" \"environment,\" and \"includes.\" \n\nNext, we need to think about what these key words mean. \"Reproduce\" means to create offspring, \"environment\" means the surroundings in which an organism lives, and \"includes\" means contains. \n\nNow, let's think about what the question is asking. The question is asking which environment is necessary for certain plant species to reproduce. \n\nFinally, let's look at the answer choices and see which one makes the most sense.\n\n-->\n\nC END"}

This is a winter sport, so it would make sense that it would be done in the snow. Diving into an Olympic-sized swimming pool would not make sense because there is no water on a snowy mountain. Beach ball is also not a winter sport, so (B) can be eliminated. That leaves us with (A) and (C). (A) is watching the sports team the Colorado Avalanches.
